# Optional Binding

Using optional binding, you can check if a value is not *nil* in an if statement, then make a new constant that stores the underlying value.

If *errorMessage* is not *nil*, a new constant *nonOptionalErrorMessage* of type *String* is created. Then the error message is printed. If *errorMessage* is *nil*, *nonOptionalErrorMessage* is never declared and the code in the else block is executed.

Itâ€™s common practice to use the same name for the new constant as the original optional variable.

In the body of the *if let* statement, *errorMessage* refers to the newly created constant of type *String*.
